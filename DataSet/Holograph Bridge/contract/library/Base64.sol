 prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute
 its contribution or any derivative works that you create.
 B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license,
 including the license conditions and limitations in section 3,
 each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
 royalty-free license under its licensed patents to make, have
